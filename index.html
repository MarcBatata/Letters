                <p class="description">My dearest Leslye, <br><br>

                    Today is a special day, not because it's your birthday itself, but because it's a day to celebrate you. I want to start this letter by telling you about a surprise we prepared with all the love in the world. Your friends and I, who love you so much, joined forces to turn a day that should have been wonderful. It turned out to be tough, but we will make this day into something unforgettable. <br><br>
                    
                    The surprise is a small gesture compared to the size of our love for you. We want you to know that your happiness is our top priority. Your birthday may have passed, but the love we feel for you continues to grow every day. We hope this surprise can brighten your heart a little more and show you just how special you are to all of us.<br><br>
                    
                    With all my love,<br>
                    Your dearest.</p>

                    In the memory of Zero, a gentle shadow lingers over our hearts. He left us with the sacred responsibility of taking care of you, of never letting tears roll down your face. It is no burden, as it is a commitment that I embrace with gratitude. A sincere commitment in honoring the love and friendship he had for you.<br><br>
                    
                    I promise, with all my being, to protect you at any cost. Your smile is my guiding light, and I will do everything to keep it shining. Zero is always going to be with us, in spirit, guiding us as he reminds us the immeasurable value you hold in our lives.<br><br>
                    
                    With eternal love,<br>

                    I've heard the stories of the past, and I understand the scars that time has left. I know the shadows of past relationships still linger over you, but I want to assure you that my love is real, sincere, and deep.<br><br>
                    
                    I am not like those who hurt you. I love you with all my heart, and my only intention is to make you happy. Please allow yourself to believe again, allow yourself to be loved and cared for the way you deserve. I promise that together we can build a present and a future filled with love and happiness.<br><br>
                    
                    My love for you is like the delicate glow of the moon that paints the night sky with its silver light, softening the shadows of existence. Love is the luminous trail of shooting stars, leaving an ephemeral trace of fulfilled wishes in the vast cosmos of human connection. The eclipse, where two hearts align and engage in the celestial dance, obscuring all doubts and uncertainties.<br><br>
                    
                    As the planets orbit in harmony, love creates a solar system in which every gesture, every glance, is a celestial body contributing to the beauty of this shared universe. Like comets cutting through the sky, love leaves a trail of burning memories that traverse the ether of time.<br><br>
                    
                    Much like the sunflower's unwavering devotion to follow the sun across the sky, my commitment to you, Moon, is akin to that of a moonflower. Just as the sunflower turns its face to bask in the warm glow of sunlight, I find myself captivated by your radiant presence. You, my dear Moon, are the center of my universe, and I, like the moonflower, am destined to follow you forever. In the quiet night, as the moonflower blooms under the celestial ballet of stars, my love for you blossoms, illuminated by the soft glow of your essence. With each passing night, I am reminded that, just as the moonflower faithfully unfolds its petals, my affection for you will continue to unfurl, revealing the depth of my feelings that mirror the timeless dance of the cosmos.<br><br>
                    
                    With unconditional love,<br>
