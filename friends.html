                <p class="description">Dear VL,<br><br>

                    Okay I know I left for a very long time, you had taken care of me since I was in middle school which is cool. I have known you since that time and I think my brain stopped developing the upcoming growth that you were all going through. To me my head is forever stuck in those good old times in the RFA group chat where Blayr wasn’t as bad of a person and where we were all happy.<br><br>
                    You being the many people who helped me and made me understand my own feelings, you were and will always be that someone who took care of me. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to let go of my own anger because unlike you, I can’t forgive easily. But I’m taking your advice by heart and trying my best to have a better understanding of the type of person I am. I realize I have a long way to go to being fully considered as a man and considered as a normal person because I have fallen into the dark pit of drugs and bad reputation since the accident at my school.<br><br>
                    I won't give up on my personality because even you showed me that no matter what happens or what will happen  you need to bounce back. I’m taking that advice to my grave because that's the most hot thing a woman could say to me.<br><br>
                
                Yours truly,<br>
                Your little shit Haru

                <p class="description">Dear Moon, <br><br>

                    I haven’t been the best person to you let alone to everyone, my past was all based on things that I hated and wished to have ruined. To me you are always going to be important. I just feel like It still should have been me if I was feeling dramatic, but I’m at least slowly starting to realize you were right about me.
                    I only had feelings for you because I still missed Edgar and labeled you as similar to his personality because of the way you acted and how you were. I missed him and still do even though I shouldn’t, I realize why you have been rejecting me constantly about my feelings for you. It was because at the end of the day I was going to say “I love you” to him, not you. It’s for the better now, but there was a moment where I was lost in you. I know that during the time you came and befriended me it was the same day I knew those feelings were real. I never got to tell it to you because of how stupid I was back then, before meeting him at least. <br><br>
                    In a way I’m also saying goodbye to those feelings and I want to be honest with you about them. I did care for you, I loved you to the point I was confused, but even now I’ll love you. Not in the romantic sense because I respect you and the partner you are dating. I respect you both, therefore I am saying I love you because you are my friend, even though we argue a lot most of the time You still handle me like any other person would. Since the situation I was labeled as bad you were still around checking up on me even though you could have been like Rei and tried to distance yourself from me because of my bad attitude. <br><br>
                    You will always be precious to me, even though I am horrible with my shit I will always be loyal and cherish you as my friend. Thank you for really being honest with me and not letting my hopes get too high when it came to you. You are the only person that I will consider real with me, someone who wouldn’t dare fake anything. I hope that you are happy with what you have, may the years bring nothing but joy to you and that you will never forget the memories you made with us if time ever does separate us with everyone. Moon, thank you for being the first person to be there when I needed someone the most. <br><br>
                    To you I will do my best to become a better person, even now I hope you are proud of me because I had access to voice logs on the server. I saw two particular people in voice call during an hour where you were gone. I could have done things and made it seem bad so you could have broken your friendship off with them, but I didn’t. I like to tell you that I have become better by that example. But there are times I want to be fucked up and start rumors and drama. I won't do that, it is probably for a good reason. I just wanted to share that with you because I don’t ever want to hide things from you let alone other people hide things from you. If you ever need to talk about something or anything in general I am here for you. <br><br>

                <p class="description"> Dear Moon, <br><br>

                    I’m going to write this letter and hope it sounds decent. We have been through a lot, even the most dramatic shit I was going through, you have been there. One thing I can talk about with you would be the times we fought, I know it was the time that broke our bond as siblings, in fact I never stopped thinking about you as a friend that is close to a sibling. You were there when the moments got rough and the fact you stood around just to make sure I was fine when I was angry and took my anger out on you. It was also the time you needed to talk through Blayr because of me trying to ignore you. It ruined our friendship and our bond, but I think it also made us realize the people who are loyal and the people we could trust during that process. For that I can say one thing today.<br><br>
                    Today is a special day for you and many people are doing their best to make up for lost time. The only reason I brought up the plan is so everyone felt included in doing something special, to have a memory in which they can hold dearly once they grow up. I wanted everyone to do this in hopes you realize that we appreciate you because I know your history and I don’t know if the others do. But you are my one and only best friend aside from the people who I love. Enjoy the days and have fun while you’re out enjoying yourself. Whatever you need I’ll be here to help you, I’m always going to be by your side as a friend and brother.<br><br>
                    Moon, thank you for being strong and staying with us in the end. Thank you for never letting yourself fall too deep into a dark spot, thank you for staying strong for us. To me you are someone I admire. I think this life I will always be inspired by you.<br><br>

                <p class="description">Dear Lesyle, <br><br> 
                    Congratulations on turning 21, I’m proud of you. You’ve been the friend and sister that I can always go to and rely on anytime even if it’s just casual talk; you’ve always been there for me even when you don’t know it. You’re amazing you know? The many smiles and laughs that happen around you are because of you, the many times friends and family turn to you. It’s amazing how much you can brighten the day and whenever there is something or someone who makes you upset you push through it and continue to smile; your strength and your patience is something that we all admire (me especially). I’m so glad that I came up to you in that orchestra class back in middle school, I’m happy that we got to know each other, I’m happy to go through the ups and downs during our time (and forever will), I’m proud to call you my friend and sister, I’m proud of the person you’ve become, and I’m proud that I can love you as my closest friend. I will forever be beside you and help you to the best of my abilities. <br><br>
                    You’re one of the many in our group that I will go through hell just to protect and help anytime. Does this sound like a love confession? Yeah it fucking does, is it gay? Well yeah but I mean it in a platonic way. But in all seriousness, I will go through hell to help you and I will be the person you can come to whenever you feel powerless or scared. And if you need I will be there to guide you, I’ll listen to all your problems, your random rambles, your vents, cravings, stories, tea, and just anything I’ll be there to listen. You make me smile and happy just by being around you and make stupid jokes together, you make my lungs go away when we do something stupid. I’ll be the demons in your head to encourage the stupid shit (your voices) and then proceed to join you on the stupid. I’m so happy that both you and I can continue making memories together and with the others, I can’t wait to see what stupid shit we’re going to do. <br><br>
                    Maybe you already know this but take your pride in your individuality, in your uniqueness, and don’t dismiss or diminish yourself, not for you, not for anyone. Honor yourself as you would honor anyone or anything you look up too. There’s a saying that was engraved in me; “Not afraid of slow progress, just afraid of standing still” it means to be persistent and patient in the learning or an opportunity process. And to keep moving forward even if it’s slow, but don’t hesitate to take it when the target is right there in front of you. I’m guessing that you’re either ugly crying or on the verge of ugly crying from all the letters we all wrote for you, but now is the time to celebrate your birthday and enjoy your time with us. We love you so much, more than you know. <br><br>

                <p class="description">Sweet Dear Angel,<br><br>

                It isn't normal for me to write a letter, let alone to someone I cherish dearly. I try my best to contain my emotions due to fear of what I am capable of exposing. However, today seems to be a good day for you and me to finally have a chat with one another, even if it's not too long or too short. Regardless, I don't think there would be enough pages to talk about our first meeting and our continued journey. One can simply try with my thoughts running through many things I always wanted to tell you.<br><br>
                To me, you are an amazing friend and have always been one. Since day one, you've been nothing but a sweetheart to me. I'll admit that even though I was one of the many victims who fell for your charm, I believe everyone could agree that we all fell for it—your friends, family, and even partners. There's something so alluring about you that makes us want to be around you more. Sometimes you've seen that through people's actions, sometimes through words. When it comes to being friends with you, it has taught me something in the process. I was the type who struggled to change, so let me tell you about how you completely changed me through those moments of knowing you.<br><br>
                I believe that there was a moment in which you changed a lot of people without knowing. From the moment you met your IRL friends, to meeting people online. Even though I admit that I grew to realize just how important you are in the group, from the moment you left everyone got quiet and even most people began to hide while others were around trying to start a conversation that ended shortly after. Truth is that through friendship you really are the glue that sticks everyone together.<br><br>
                When we first met, you were one of those people who continued a story that I was creating with my friend. I believe you were Rika on the Pony Town server. Kaeya and I found you and decided to roleplay with you. To say I wasn't impressed by your skill would be a lie; the truth is, I was jealous of your writing and ideas, which coincidentally mirrored mine. I loved how you portray your character; it was something that an actor like yourself is worthy of a compliment. I've shared my story with you many times, expressing my concerns and hearing yours in return. Although some details have faded, overshadowed by the multitude of memories we've shared, I distinctly remember the conversations about the recent situation with your old friend, Blayr—an intriguing character, based on what you've shared. It was during these moments of you expressing your frustrations that our bond began to form.<br><br>
                Blayr was someone in your life with whom I realized you had a strong connection, a best friend for whom you harbored feelings. I know the story all too well; you described how it began, with them manipulating your emotions and playing with you because you were in the spotlight, and who wouldn't want to share that spotlight? I also recall the unforgettable moments—the shared dates and outings. Through it all, you had made a promise to that friend, vowing not to break the bond even when anger surfaced. Yet, the way your privacy was abruptly exposed, I agree, shouldn't have happened like that. But I also recognize that you're the type to consider your emotions, something many people lack the courage to do. You ended the friendship because your feelings were toyed with, a move most wouldn't have the strength to make. Instead of trying to salvage the friendship, you took a different path, deciding to sever ties due to the disrespect. From there, you encouraged others to do the same and cut off the friendship. I believe you were always the first to engage and the first to take a stance. Your strength in standing up for what you believe in is admirable, and it's a testament to your integrity and the value you place on genuine connections.<br><br>
                You became a leader without intending to, establishing boundaries that marked the first time I saw you take a stand, not just to those around you, but also to yourself. It was a significant step, albeit one that came with its own share of pain, as it was the first instance of betrayal from someone close to you. I was relieved to hear that, despite the difficulty of letting go, you emerged from it with minimal pain. Moving on, despite the challenges, showcased your resilience, and that's when I truly started to appreciate that quality in you. It's one of the reasons I began calling you Lumie, a shortened and enduring version of Lumi, which means light or snow. You emanate a warmth that's always present, creating moments of coziness and camaraderie with friends and family, much like watching snowfall outside while gathered around the fireplace. It's a beautiful image that captures the essence of who you are.<br><br>
                When you finally allowed me to meet your friends, along with Kaeya, it was a delightful day for all of us. For me, it was a moment of calm, a temporary respite to relax. It wasn't until I came to you about my worries, particularly my struggles with depression and the high PTSD stemming from my hospitalization, that I felt truly vulnerable for the first time. However, it was also a moment of learning for me, a lesson in patience and forgiveness, something you've been teaching me along the way.<br><br>
                It was challenging for me to let go of the past because I believed that by doing so, I would lose a part of what defines me. I convinced myself that without the pain of my past, I wouldn't be able to recognize myself. It was an excuse, a way to continually relieve the pain with my ex-lover and the group I was involved with. You played a pivotal role in making me realize that, despite claiming to have forgiven them, I hadn't truly let go. I vividly recall the wise words you shared during one of our play sessions.<br><br>
                "You can say you forgive people easily. Anything you say is easy to say, even when you don't mean it. But my question is, do you actually forgive them?"<br><br>
                Those words made me pause and reflect deeply. It took me a while to acknowledge that, in reality, I hadn't forgiven them or anyone who had caused me harm. I kept reopening the wound, as if repeatedly stabbing at the healing process. That moment was a revelation, a realization that I had a long journey ahead to heal. Despite enduring a lot, I had my reasons for resisting this healing process. However, when I discussed it with you, you offered me comforting words. You reassured me that I didn't need to rush the healing process, that forgiving people takes time and courage. I was surprised to find in you someone who was supportive and understanding, offering me a new perspective on forgiveness and healing.
                forgiving people even if they were in the wrong. Your boyfriend at the time specifically.<br><br>
                I was slowly introduced to the group chat and little did I know that I was only going to learn more about what you were to share with me. Even if I didn’t talk much you were there to teach me even if you weren’t around or if I wasn’t saying much in the chats. I however ended up hearing a lot about one person in particular in which you nearly were giving up everything for. It broke me to see you everyday struggling to keep a relationship that wasn’t there anymore. I believe you used to give him the nickname of Momo, It must be painful. Truth is that he had used you many times, I was surprised that you didn’t realize that until it was too late. It was then that I came to realize your weakness, you were sensitive to emotions, let alone to emotions that involved your lover. The people who are sensitive to emotions for not themselves but their lovers are the ones I always envy because it means that you were someone who was willing to commit to the relationship.<br><br>
                For you to risk everything for a man who you had come to love dearly, only to figure out that they betrayed you and used you in many ways. It hurts the person who isn’t involved. You had all the rights to be angry and upset because not only did he use you for money, he had tried forcing you to come to his country while he did nothing. That is what upsetted me the most when you were crying about him. It is the fact that he didn’t do anything for you in return and you wasted nearly everything for him, even close to running away from your home to go see him when your parents didn’t approve of him. I also wanted to tell you that it was for the best, that you deserve better.<br><br>
                We all probably had that thought when you came out saying that you broke things off with Momo, what made us upset is that in the end you didn’t reclaim anything. You didn’t go to him telling him that he owes you the amount of money that he took from you, that he started to ask you. The guy was older than you yet still asked for money, what made me upset is that even after the break up he acted like nothing impacted him and let alone he has nitro meaning that he did have money laying around especially for him to waste it on perks in discord. That is the one thing we were mad about yet you didn’t say anything. It made me wonder why, turns out it’s because you also took part of the relationship to blame, you told me what you did wrong in your end and even told me that he wouldn’t be able to pay you back in the end because of the amount he makes. I wanted to be angry with you, to start issues and dramas with the guy, but you stopped me because you told me that in the end it just wasn’t meant to be.<br><br>
                How can you do that to yourself when you know you deserve better? It is frustrating when you do that, but it also proves to me the type of girl you are. You did it, yet you are seen as the bad person on the other side. It isn’t fair to see that be done to you, that they all see you as the person that hurt him because of a relationship that he didn’t put effort on, you let it happen. That’s why I find you to be one of the strongest people among the friend group. It is that patience and forgiveness that you share that makes you the strongest out of any of us combined, it isn’t easy for anyone to let go of that pain, yet you make it seem so easy when others ask if you’re okay. <br><br>
                It all changed when I saw you at night time to talk about the kids, about Joseph and the others. I remember you had panic attacks constantly at night and always asked for the other guys to sleep with you because you didn’t like the silence or the thought of sleeping alone. It was the most and the hardest thing for me to watch, because to me you looked miserable. Those nights I know how much in pain you were, because there were words that you said that made me worried about you, if you were going to be okay in the end or if you would even survive the year with the things that you were saying. It was painful because you were strong in front of others, but when night came it was as if your walls were destroyed, from there it was clear to me that your forgiveness and patience could only ever go far for you. You were sensitive to that, that emotions and sacrifice that you were willing to do to see the other happy. Yet your happiness was never thought about when it came to a relationship.
                To me you will always be that strong woman who tries her best regardless of what is displayed to her. You have no idea just the inspiration you have for everyone, because when the littles admire you I have to always remind them that you are also human and struggle with your own situations that are placed upon you. <br><br>
                I do not understand why men hurt you when you are nothing but a loving person, it is then that I realize also just what issue comes in someone so caring. You picked up a few habits from other people which are bad for you, self-hatred, and mostly the personality of anger management when it comes to things. I can only say that I blame Momo for impacting your life that much. It took a good moment for you to get rid of that type of thinking style, however, when alone you try your best to boost yourself by calling yourself cute, adorable, and funny when the time comes. I understand why you’re doing it, it is because many people in our friend group lack self-love. The fact you realized that you make a big impact on everyone is enough to make me see that you are someone who is self-aware. What worries me is just how self-aware you are. There was a moment in which you remembered the things that the kids liked, even the things that your friends enjoyed the most during that time we were doing secret santa. You were the main one that we went to because you know somewhat what each person liked. It was then when we realized that your medication was the main thing keeping your memory from working properly which I would say is like a debuff from your side.
                We poked fun at it because we didn’t realize that we all went to you to ask for recommendations for buying things for each other for secret santa. It was a fun situation regardless of what was done, turns out you knew the gifts we all had for one another except your own gift. That was one of the joyful moments in my life time, where we all gathered to make eachother gifts even virtually when we all didn’t have much to give physically due to where we all are. It is that moment you brought in this friendship.<br><br>
                The moment now may seem like it faded, but I loved them all the same, even when you tried to help with Keith and Mika’s relationship if you know what I mean, You had helped pick the ring for him and not know did he send you the wooden chest filled with letter, you were also the one who made the letters and rewrote them due to the rain staining the letters and ruining the ink inside them. For you to take the time out of your hands to help Keith out like that is something that not a lot of people are willing to do.<br><br>
                You wrote the letters and tried to copy his handwriting in the process. Not only that you gave Mika a cheat sheet of the list of letters that each Contained, the only one letter that ever survived was the kissing one I believe where he had kissed the letter and made it obvious, Due to the pile of letters a few were saved such as the “What drives me crazy about you”, “New years Eve”, and “The kissing one” where he had kissed it. I am sure there are more, but I can’t recall all of them. I believe that was when everyone had set Keith as the ideal man due to how much he did to make Mika fall for him. Giving letters and even giving them a promise ring for being their companion for eternity due to not believing in marriage.
                It makes sense, Keith had been technically raised by his friends whenever his parents weren’t around, he also raised you in the process which I had come to see that you got a bit of his personality.<br><br>
                You are a giver like him, a leader who strives for more and sometimes are ambitious when you want something. That trait you had gotten from him, it is probably because of your history with him since you met him at such an early age and gotten a bit of him. However, I also saw that you were also raised by Deahyun which for me isn’t ideal since you also got a bit of bad habits from him, such as anger management and cursing. Don’t get me wrong, it’s cute, I just find it funny that you basically were raised by friends too. I see those personalities of theirs onto you. I also see you trying to change to have a calmer personality. It is probably for your own desire to keep yourself in a calmer state or so things don’t backfire on you.<br><br>
                I realized you had become more cautious since the Blayr situation. You also became more aware about your surroundings and sensitive to those around you due to your relationships. What hurt us was the friends that were coming and going. I remember you wanted to be a bit popular on Amino and asked for all of us to get amino so we can like and hype you up because there were other people bothering you and acting like they are all big. I believe it started with the Max guy. He took care of you in manners that I wish I didn’t know. It was more of a personal relationship, however, I know what he was trying to do, Amino guys like him are only there for one thing when they see a girl. For him to focus on gaming and have no job was a big flag. What confirmed was when you said that he had helped you and began to also constantly look for companionship. A situation where he leads you on about a relationship only for him to not commit to it due to fear. What I had feared the most is that he lied to you about his previous relationship and how the girl had ended up committing suicide, for starters I really assumed that she had her reasons, with the screenshots you showed its pretty clear why someone like that can’t have a normal relationship. He focused only on fame and never really on the results after that fame that is temporary.<br><br>
                I believe another situation was with LJ who is a friend of yours from the UK, works at a cafe and he loves to party? It could be me but I’m starting to see the pattern of being around people with the most messed up history and relationship with their ex’s or friends. Personally they were far worse than the Max guy. What made it funny is the whole situation of them wanting a relationship, but always coming back to their ex. I loved that you tried to help them to at least see the biggest picture. Regarding assisting, I believe that they were just trying to use your kindness so you would fall for them seeing how often they talked about their ex and how they kept going on about “They will change,” and “I know I broke up with them for a reason.” Although, I’m proud you saw what they were trying to do. Playing along with their game and even until now they never replied.<br><br>
                
                
                What was a horrible situation is the NIPUNI server accident. It had a lot of bad reputations from what I was seeing in my alt account. Puni herself wasn’t a bad person, however, the people she was with clearly acted like childrens for being Mods of that server. In fact it was funny when we heard that you applied to the Puni mod server because you were trying to do something funny. I remember it, you only signed up to it for the fun of it because you were confident that they wouldn’t pick you. We all laughed when we realized that your plan completely backfired on you. From there you were a baby mod and were now training to be a mod in that server, with many people coming and going. It was then that Rain, Keith, Emi, and Mika decided to help you be promoted even though you wanted to be demoted as soon as possible because of schedule. You tried to tell them about your busy schedule, however they all insisted that you stick around and see if it’s fitting with how Puni was kind to you.<br><br>
                The problem was never the owner herself, from that moment you were targeted due to one of the mods there had eyes on you. However, it seemed like the same mods had acted like they were a big thing due to their status by calling their members kids or babies when most of them were older than them. What was strange was how easily one of them fell in love with you. Bebe being the lesbien of the group in which she caught feelings for you. What was upsetting was that you weren’t the only victim in that server in which they forced painted a bad image of you there. Because you wanted the favor of not causing issue or trouble in general you were stuck with Bebe the entire time there.<br><br>
                I believe what had caught me by surprise is that through your time there it was as if they were all forcing each other to get a partner through modding and admin abuse. What I hated and what I also learned is your maturity level in dealing the situation. You had manage to not only try to not involve yourself in the love drama, you were trying to simply make friends and I believe it was that moment where you lost majority of the group of friends due to the rumors that he spread around you. I was the one who heard it all. The rumors that were spreading about you and Kai were that you both were in on it and tried to abuse the kids by becoming mods yourself. It had not only been abuse but because you told Puni you wanted to step down as mod it caused more drama and more rumors which is one of the many reasons that Puni decided to reset the whole server and move everyone to the other one instead. A fresh start, however I don’t think she realized that there were still some people abusing the other party which were you and Kai. I believe due to the bullying it impacted Kai the most and therefore deleted his account just to not be involved with Nine due to him making a big drama out of the situation.<br><br>
                The drama didn’t die down as many people wished it would have. A lot of the younger people asked Bebe and Nine what happened and since they are the most social and active in the community they would tell everyone the details of it. However, unfortunately it was bad for Nine and Kai since they are the ones who were publically out and loving one another. Time difference also didn’t help so he ended up deleting his account from what I heard on the server.<br><br>
                Proudly you can say that you were in their heads rent free. It is sad that it had to go far to someone needing to delete their account. For Bebe to try to go through your privacy through other people was bad enough. I also felt bad when you showed me that Elise girl was stalking your social media and due to your carrd information she was able to get access to your social media. Leaving the community was a good choice, I believe Elise wasn’t the only girl stalking your page, the two love birds; King and Lynx were also the ones stalking your pfp and activity due to Lynx always saying “they are on'' in the r rated channel where they hide most of the time from the server. The way you dealt with it was fair. However, I’m angry for you for forgiving them so easily. I won’t judge you with what they’ve done, but it was gross in that community, so for that I am proud of you because for someone who barely gets stalked is enough to show that you save yourself rather than let them continue, I believe it gives you points for looking innocent too.<br><br>
                That is what I admired about you since you gave me those screenshots, you were able to act on it and also share where your boundaries are at, I didn’t like how sweet the other people were about it. They shrugged it off and just told the mods to not do it again, it’s clear that even that community isn’t worth much except the owner herself.<br><br>
                I recollect that moment after, I believe it was during the community and your grandfather passing away at the same time which didn’t help in anyone’s case. It makes sense that it was a good exit to stay out of the relationship at the time. Momo wasn’t exactly helping and acting like the victim. Although to see you end the relationship first took me by surprise, I just wish you would have done it sooner.<br><br>
                Let me not let you forget about our recent case. During the time of talking to Max and LJ I was also going through things. I came to you because of a love condition I was going through—who to come to when the perfect Cupid is around to give love advice. I came to you because I fell in love with one of your friends, that being Emi out of all people. You were very upset when I told you that, it is because you know why. I also saw it too. She isn’t someone to take into a relationship, I understood that, I wasn’t planning on admitting my feelings to her anytime soon. I personally didn’t want to make myself look like a fool. I told you about it and even then I cried a lot because I was frustrated that I knew why I wasn’t allowed to be with her. I also know that you told me just why I can’t. That it’s best to talk to her rather then you, but I knew it well my feelings were going to be rejected. It is because of what could be going on in the background of her life and her mental mind.<br><br>
                As I write this I’m realizing that you told me it was best to not also do anything yet, but I understand why, it is also because I know what I’m capable of doing, that I wouldn’t be able to show as much love or appreciation as I would like to. I wouldn’t be fully honest about my own feelings and only focus on her, I would be rejecting myself entirely just to have her smiling. I wouldn’t be the perfect person for her, although I wished we could have given it a try even for a bit. I wish I could be capable of making her smile, to be the one she runs to, but now I know that the person who she needs to run to isn’t me, it is herself in hopes of her recovery mentally. I know that both her and I aren’t ready for a relationship, but I did hope one day she will be able to realize that not all guys are bad. That there are some who wish her the best. You hearing me vent about it has helped me. You said<br><br>
                “If you are going to confess to her I suggest you don’t act out of love but out of consideration of what she needs, not what she wants or what you want.”<br><br>
                The wisest words I heard from you. What hurt the most was the words you specifically said to me.<br><br>
                “You both say you are all fine, I know that isn’t true but I’ll act dumb about it. I know you guys like lying, I just hope one day you all are able to realize that you are perfect with your limits, let yourself fail in a relationship or fail in a class, that just means you’re winning. You guys are just scared to face reality,”<br><br>
                Which is true. Even if it hurted when you said that it was only true because the majority of us are scared of failure. Even I admit that.<br><br>
                Maybe I should learn a thing or two from you about failing, I won’t look the best but I know that each step is only to grow. I think that is what You were going with, it’s the realistic truth that some of us need. Someone to knock us back to reality. Maybe that is why everyone loves you, it is due to you being honest and not lying when you are feeling uneasy. You speak out because you are someone vocal. I like that in a person.<br><br>
                That is why I will not confess as suggested. I can not fill a love that is not meant for me, but that doesn’t mean I can’t love her from afar. That I won’t lie. It is also why I had decided to follow what I too wanted in my life. To go into combat, you are the first to know about it, I hope you are the first to know about it. I’ll be sure to let you know my progress in the meantime. But I have a reason to bring up these memories that we all shared with you. Let’s go to a more recent situation.<br><br>
                It was the time you met Luke. I had come to realize just how much you were in pain when it came to loving him. I also realized that everyone blamed you for having to be with that guy. What do I mean by that?<br><br>
                “He was such an ugly guy, you could do better,”<br>
                “You have a taste in interesting people,”<br>
                Or even it goes far to saying “he isn’t worth it.”<br><br>
                The issue is that everyone doesn’t realize one thing about you when it comes to loving Luke. He was a complicated case, I strongly believe you loved him and he loved you at one point in time. That you have all the right to care for him. You had thought of him as attractive in your mind or in your eyes. To you it was love, however, what I didn’t approve of was how much you were sacrificing just for someone’s satisfaction—which I’m glad that you acted on your own and decided to end the relationship even if it came to ending it in the most interesting way. Even when you didn’t say much about the relationship. It was clear that you suffered both mentally and even physically when it came to him.<br><br>
                I believe what everyone was upset for you was how he treated you and regardless of how he treated you it was because he did it without shame in front of us. Disrespecting you and such. Even during that time you had tried your best to maintain the relationship.
                Now please bare with me why I’m bringing up all these memories. It is because I know you, to you these aren’t horrible memories. You cherish each memory you made with each person, if it’s your ex or your partner you cherish all of them because you had come to learn that without the situation of such not happening, they all connect to one thing, that they all helped you make you who you are today. Everytime I ask you about the past you never fail to always have a smile on your face when you talk about it. Sometimes I ask you a bit more personal questions and it just seems to me you always tell it with pride and with confidence. I wondered why and even asked that maybe you were just trying to make yourself feel better through the process. Seems like in the end I was completely wrong.<br><br>
                You love sharing the memories because it’s your way of admitting your failures, a manner of sharing those to others that they too can fail and be just fine. What I’m surprised about is that through them all you smile and even encourage yourself about your achievements. A pride you hold dearly to.<br><br>
                I’m proud of what had come and what you had managed to do throughout the years of meeting you. Recognize and give yourself a moment to appreciate yourself for what you have gone through. Each memory you had made is what made you who you are. The moments you shared with everyone and even the smallest gestures in which your history provided you someone many of us never take for granted. A lesson in which the world tries to teach us. You had managed to deal with the worst and still learned to navigate life with ease, but of course that is because you took something we others fail to do. You took time and made it your own with it. When I talk about the bad always remember one thing that you showed.<br><br>
                Think of the bad as if it was all good as if they were achievements and check marks you had managed to do. Do not be ashamed of them, be happy that you had allowed it to happen because the woman we know today wouldn’t have done that if she never experienced what life had to throw at her. I’ll congratulate you for all the hard work you have done.
                Now let’s focus on the good as equally as we did with the bad.<br><br>
                The moments you were there for Zero. In fact he left a letter for you which will be brought up. I will separate it for you so you can have a better understanding of the split letter. It was done around December 1st of 2023. Time zone was 3:52 AM Japan in Eiju General Hospital. I hope you enjoy reading it after reading this letter.<br><br>
                You managed to always inspire Zero, even though it is considered the “Gaho Family” You were the one who inspired the kids on being aesthetically pleasing and even taught them a few things here and there. Consider it a moment of bonding. Unfortunately I never got to spend enough time with Zero as he was always around you. To me I like to think he loved you dearly because to him you were just like a mother. I know Zero considered you as his favorite person regardless of partner. It was because since the beginning you were there, moving aside partners or friendships he cared for you and always did ask about you whenever he was online and you were busy. What he loved the most about you was the stories you made up on the spot and the voice acting you did during the telling of those stories. What I miss the most about everything was when he would talk about the situations at his school, he use to love going to school because he could walk freely.<br><br>
                He wanted to take us to the cafes and even told us that he would one day bring us food and stream his meals. It’s unfortunate now that we never got to fully see it. I think you and I had the hardest time because we know him on a deeper level, it is something I have been meaning to share and say to someone. The day we found out he passed away hurt me. The feeling still hurts when remembering him and even now I have a hard time accepting he is gone, the thing is that it’s gotten bad that I would cry every single minute remembering him. You had helped me a lot in trying to move on, but it’s hard when you have managed to talk to someone, only to find out they passed away the next day or weeks. When I read the letters he left it makes me cry and remember the things he had done and the things he was feeling: there are moments when I think about not being a good father figure to him. But you told me that I tried my best. It hurts, but I’m glad that you’re letting me take my time little by little even if it seems like I’m taking forever. Letting go won’t be easy even if I finish reading the letters a hundred times. I also have a sense that it won’t help everyone because although he had left his last words it is also being memories and forcing memories onto them.<br><br>
                But he left them for a reason, I need to at least comply to it and hope everyone will be ready when the time comes. Regardless you were there for even the lowest moments of my life.
                Another good memory was when you had given me a chance to roleplay with you. The moments we shared were the ones we laughed at. Especially during those moments when I first met Mika or when we make the characters that we play do the complete opposite of their personality. I can say that I have fun whenever you’re around, you tend to brighten everyone’s day with just a singular perspective.<br><br>
                Teaching you a bit on how to shade and color is a different story, I remember you wanted to draw dicks at one point which lead to an awkward conversation. Regardless of the awkwardness you managed to make me teach you how to draw them in the end. You were the most perverted girl in the group. Seeing you grow to become more mature feels different. It must be the feeling that your parents have when they realize you’re growing. You can’t be young forever and be kept in the dark. At one point you’re going to learn nearly everything and family secrets that are placed on one another. <br><br>
                I’m sure it is hard at the moment as well, not everyone can live forever. It is what we consider life so different, at one point you need to learn to lose the person you loved the most. Recollecting how you were, you were a sweet girl who was determined to make everything and anything work. How time changes you due to seeing growth and seeing you mature, it is because you are growing through the process of living. You lost your grandfather last year—since then I have seen you change from that young girl with so much faith to someone who learned to accept life, however, someone who also feels betrayed whenever an act of kindness is shown. You aren’t used to it, I know that for sure, is because of how many times Zero tried to compliment you and you never took it, you immediately shifted the spotlight to another topic. I sometimes wondered why you did that. Maybe you didn’t like people complimenting you, but I’ve come to learn that by spending time with you, you simply feel like youu need to punish yourself. Whatever you’ve done in the past is like punishing and limiting yourself to what you want or who you want. This doesn’t limit the negative trait.<br><br>
                One of the many positive traits that impacted you was the man you had met through the dramatic change in your life. I do not know exactly just what happened as it is a story that I am sure you will tell someday with full details. That partner has not only been with you but also has been alongside you when the time was needed. I can remember the more depth part you have shared. You were lost, even to the point that your health was declining. But for your own safety and health you decided to act on what you believed is right. It was a funny situation when hearing about it, you gotten better both mentally and physically compared to what you use to be.<br><br>
                I give you my admiration for going through such lengths. Truth is that I’m sure everyone was worried about you because of the sudden ending of the relationship and wishing to be in another relationship so suddenly, I guess we forget that you are someone who takes their time to consider their wrong and a moment to breathe. A moment to take time for yourself. I wish that I could have done things to be able to know just what or how you do things when everyone isn’t looking. Maybe my curiosity of what goes on behind closed doors. Nobody is perfect, but to everyone’s eyes you always show perfection. Just how a mother does, maybe that is why the children like you the most out of everyone.<br><br>
                You have a tendency to show pride. A show in which you only let them see the perfection and sometimes the calm side, what some do not know is just what you go through on a daily base. It makes me wonder just why you don’t easily get angry like the rest of us or annoyed. It is that you show sadness instead and stay silent. I wonder just how you got so vocal yet silent about your situations. Only those who are lucky to get close to you will know. It shows just who the people you value and more.<br><br>
                As I write this letter you know very well where I’m going with this. It isn’t a reminder of the bad situation, think of it as what you had told me, the past made who you are today. What you are told isn’t a bad memory, it isn’t a traumatic situation but a situation where you survived. That only means that you are ready for the world and what it will give you in the long run. Whatever letters you get will be nothing but memories they all share or appreciation and impact you had done. They are all ever so grateful to have known and had come in contact with you at one point in their lives. To me you are what I always wanted from a friend. Someone who listens, who wishes to talk and share as much as I do. To me you are beyond perfect regardless of the imperfection you claim you have.<br><br>
                For whatever comes in the future, I know you’ll do great, because if you could survive the many betrayal, the many situations, and impacts that life threw at you? Then you can make it through another day. Your ego is as high as any other. For your love life, I know it’ll be just fine. Simply look up and smile. The pain is temporary, you however are an eternity. I know this person you claim to love dearly is the one for you, he not only showed respect, he showed loyalty, compassion, and understanding. To him he probably cherises you, as some men do, we cherish and worship the woman we love. I don’t know if it is something I do, but I tend to love the woman and keep my eyes on her only because I fell in love with ease for only one, never two. I do not know if this lover of yours is the same, but I know one thing about falling in love.<br><br>
                When you have your first love, it is someone you cherish, you can be lucky and go through with it until marriage while some it’s temporary. But, speaking as a man and no a boy, a man will love and mature his mind to keep you safe and loved, a man will know that you are the one in their eyes, that they will lay their loyalty even through the bad, they will accept all of you, find your anger, your sadness, and your laughter beautiful. They will shower you with love, but a boy will only play until bored. They are the ones that never last a day with a woman, let alone a perfect one such as yourself. Take it with a grain of salt, maybe it is the case that I speak for him or I speak for his heart. Whatever it is, I know that he loves you dearly, because the way I hear him mention you and be with you, it sounds to me that he too fell in love for the first time. That’s called true love, welcome Moon, welcome to that party of a hopeless romantic who loves too much.<br><br>
                From here on out I believe it will be in due time that you find yourself in a suitable spot for what you want to be. For the future you need to think about yourself and your living state. Everyone has an issue when trying to figure out what they want to do. Sometimes there are moments you finally find them but it’s a little too late to start it, you have time to mess around and have fun. Turning 21 is a age where you can experience life at its fullest without horrible consequences—it’s a little different for hispanics, I am aware that for them you guys are about family and want the family to stick together regardless of where you are and even be strict when being accepted. It is that lucky trait you got in being together as a family, it is the motive that many people wished to have; stick together like a family for it is more important than anything. A relationship and a bond is very much important. That is probably why the children’s love you so much, you aren't just teaching them a wise manner, but you are teaching them to be together and to count on one another as if we were all family.<br><br>
                I realize that it is probably you who made it possible for this friend group to grow and treat each other as if we were all family, due to the lack of support on our side it is you who brought us together. Without you I believe we wouldn’t have come to this conclusion.
                Now I’ll say my thank you. I have written too much in this letter than previously expected. It is the smallest memory that I can’t help but remember. Like the one where Kaeya was playing with you and made you gamble on Genshin Impact because you wanted Zhongli. I believe that was the most time I ever saw you desperate in getting a character. Even the recent one where you got back into it and wasted a lot only to lose the 50/50 and get an electro character you didn’t want. At least it wasn’t a weapon which is better. I recall another situation where you and Rain had spent a lot of time together. You two would always gossip and scare each other when it came to a late friend named Ahria. Although her history wasn’t the best, you guys kept her pure thoughts in mind. It is better that way, I would prefer to keep the good things she tried doing rather than the horrible. I believe you told me that you guys were too scared because it was the night that Keith was invited to the wedding in Canada and there was the church cult where people were around.<br><br>
                From there you guys stayed up all night sharing conspiracies and ideas of what had happened or what could happen. It was to the point none of you slept or if so you slept a little, even asked for Keith to get in call with you guys. To me it was funny seeing that, throughout the days. Although it's best I come clean to you when I was invited. The kid that I met with the cousin—the bride. The child is mine. Unfortunately for me I am not involved anymore, so I’ll let you in with that little secret you and I can share. I have my own issues at home but that is something I thought I should get off my chest and share with you due to how much I trust you with that. Or anyone really, people just don’t ask about me so I don’t share much if it isn’t asked. You already know me.<br><br>
                I’ll see how I can end this letter. I don’t want to go too far into details about my situation, but I do want to admit that you are someone who many agree are trustworthy. You know when to keep secrets and know when to stop yourself when necessary. What is well loved about you is that a lot of times you don’t like sharing until you have asked someone for their permission, it is always valuable to have someone like that. To ask if it is okay to share a topic that you want to talk about with another person. It’s adorable too because you always stutter and end up typing to the person and asking them for permission if you can talk about it or not. I found it a cute little habit that you had grown not only for yourself but also to those around you since they see that you do respect boundaries. You always try to be the best and make sure everyone is comfortable with the topic or even having the conversation in general. To me at least, it seemed that you never once tried to be bad and force a conversation the other party didn’t want to.<br><br>
                It however made you more open and more talkative and initiating the conversation. Not a lot of people tend to do that due to the fear of judgment, I am sure you also are shy when the moment appears, but it’s normal to feel like that, it is the fact you try to not be too shy as often, you speak up your mind from time to time when the moment rises.<br><br>
                Your words itself is something I also admire. When you roleplay you recently started to do things that you didn’t do originally, you became the character and tried putting your mind into that character. That writing and acting is something that not many people can do with ease. An example would be Mila and Daehyun who struggle to really portray a character without giving away too much. However people like Rain or Keith tend to overwhelm the reader with too much information and too many hidden topics which doesn’t help the other party in trying to decipher a proper response but keeps the suspension. Your writing is in the middle. You keep yourself limited and make sure the other party gets an advantage when needed. It is like an equal fight between two people with the same amount of strength. However, you always tend to give the other the win. That I admire, it is that you know how to force your character into the setting and even without much information you play along.<br><br>
                Maybe that is why I love having you as my roleplay partner. It is that you know when to play along and when not to. You know how to control yourself, not many people can do that, many like to share enough for the other person to the point it’s overwhelming for the other. You stop at a point and even sometimes those bad habits get the better of you and you completely avoid the topic about yourself completely.<br><br>
                Let’s go down the list of yourself physically, your face is adorable, I believe you were someone who didn’t enjoy your looks. However, to everyone, I can say that you are simply adorable, everything you stand for is beauty, your body actually reminds me of those renaissance paintings with a lady. I am sure that you always wondered if a guy doesn’t not a body like yours, however seeing the photos you had posted I believe that you are a likable woman. Body especially so I am sure that beauty, you are an adorable woman with a heart made of steel. Although I don’t think physically is something you should focus, your personality itself speaks for you.<br><br>
                That is why many people love that about you, you are always able to express yourself in many ways. That is a value of someone that only you can achieve.
                The letter itself will speak as it is, you were and are someone who should remember your achievements regardless of where you are. If not I’ll be your reminder that you are a strong person, an admirable girl.<br><br>
                Celebrate your birthday as there are many years to come. 21 is a number you will always remember since your life will only begin from there. Drink as much as you want, let yourself experience what life has to keep giving you. Go wild and live the life of an American, eating, drinking, and partying. I do suggest something that you should do before you turn 25 or 27. Live a life that you always wanted, invite or force friends outside so you can hang out, do gatherings and just party as much as needed with them, never look back to the regrets or let them hold you back because they again are just temporary images. I hope that in the mean time I was able to remind you of how an amazing friend and person you are. Many of the others may not say it constantly, but I’ll remind you for the sake of them.<br><br>
                To everyone you are special, you have shared many memories with them. You given everyone advices that they needed to hear, if they aren't going to listen then it is best to know your limits and stand off. You had given everyone support and had been strong even during the most hard moments in life. Truth is that everyone has been sad since the confirmation of Zero’s death, you had your moments where you cried and felt upset, but everyone who didn’t know what you did knew that you were strong. I actually asked my Joseph if you did cry or envied Zero because you weren’t exactly expressing your sadness when you spoke.<br><br>
                I had to explain to a few littles that you had your moments, but for them to be strong someone needs to be their pillar, that being you, so you made a huge impact on them in which they admire you.<br><br>
                As I sit down take a moment to write this, I’ll admit that a flood of emotions overwhelms me, and finding the right words to express the depth of my gratitude becomes both a challenge and an honor to do so. There are moments in life when we encounter individuals who leave an indelible mark on our hearts, and you are undoubtedly one such person that encounters the endless possibilities that life ever gives.<br><br>
                Gratitude, is something within me that I can express, extends beyond a mere expression of thanks; it's an acknowledgment of the impact you've had on my life. Your presence has been a guiding light, a luck that many had privilege in acknowledging you. You've been the steady anchor to everyone, a source of strength when the winds of life threatened to knock me off course.<br><br>
                The simple yet profound acts of kindness, the genuine warmth in your gestures, and the unwavering support during times of struggle have not gone unnoticed. In fact, they have woven a comfort that is sometimes filled with curiosity , whether in words or deeds, and has created a sanctuary where many felt seen, valued, and truly understood.<br><br>
                It's not just the grand gestures, but the subtle nuances of your character that make me grateful to know you. Your kindness is as pure as anything the world could ever touch, your empathy feels like a soothing tone of indifference. In a world that often feels chaotic and demanding, you've been a haven of authenticity and sincerity.<br><br>
                Our shared laughter, the shared silences, and the shared moments have become chapters in a story I hold close to my heart. Your friendship is a treasure, and the lessons learned through our experiences together have been invaluable. You've taught me the beauty of compassion, the strength in vulnerability, and the enduring power of genuine connection.
                So, as I express my gratitude, it's not just for the moments of joy and laughter but for the quiet, steadfast companionship during times of tears and the trouble this world has given us. You've been a pillar of support, a confidant, and, above all, a true friend.<br><br>
                In a world where gratitude is sometimes overlooked, I want you to know that your presence in my life is something I deeply appreciate. I am grateful for you, for the beautiful moments we've been able to make together, and for the unwritten chapters that await us.
                Thank you, Moon, for being the extraordinary person you are and for gracing my life with your presence. Thank you for letting me meet such a beautiful Angel that the gods sent from the heavens.<br><br>

                Today is a day to celebrate, you finally turning 21 is the most amazing moment. I remember I met you when you were 19 and even then I was considered the bad person because of my history. <br><br>
                
                To be fair I’m happy enough that through meeting you I was able to meet other new people. I got to experience another moment in my life when I was younger. Sure it wasn’t the best history, yes I may had fucked up in the past, of course I am fucked in the head. But through that I was able to keep up with everyone and more importantly I was able to know more about you in the process. <br><br>
                
                It was a pleasure knowing you, now I’m in my journey of marriage and I will let you know what to expect from a guy at my age. Take care and enjoy your birthday and many years to come! <br><br>

                    Your name, Moon, fits you perfectly. Why I may ask? In a spiritual meaning, the moon comes in many phrases in which it goes in a cycle of enlightenment or changes in time. You have gone through many experiences in many stages of your life and in this current stage you’re in now. Throughout those cycles you went through, I observe and see how you come out glowing brighter than ever in the center of many friends’ night skies. I know for certain, from being a part of your life, you helped and cared for many people along the way. You go beyond your limits to make sure your family is well and not getting into trouble. I always admired your heart and how your presence was always someone’s moonlight. <br><br>
                    
                    There’s many things I wish to say more, about how much admiration and gratitude I feel for you. From how strong and beautiful you are and hoping your life is full of happiness and abundance. Until then, these are the words I’ll confess in this little letter. <br><br>
                    
                    Continue to be the moon in our lives, but also be the moon in yours too. <br><br>
                    
                    Sincerely,<br>

                    We talk from time to time, but you’re really a cool person. I think that during this time I was able to have help through you and your wise words. You are pretty sweet and were there for me when I needed it. I don’t talk to you a lot, but for a person who I barely know, you were one of the sweetest people that I considered amazing. I still do and even with my situation about my mother.<br><br>
                    Friend, I hope that this birthday brings you nothing but pure joy and I hope that you get to drink and party all night long for it to be a wonderful day for you and everyone. I also hope you get lots of gifts in the process. Enjoy it and cheers to you for finally turning of age to drink!<br><br>
