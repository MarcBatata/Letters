                <p class="description" >Dear Eomma,<br><br>

                    I write this letter because I am told to write it. Actually I was told about your birthday and what had happened. If I was in your place I would have complained to my mom and dad about the party and told my cousins. I don’t know how you could handle that and be patient about it. To me you’re ideal when it comes to waiting and having patience for someone that isn’t me. It is why I look up to you for being a great mother figure. You always do the best you can and sometimes people underestimate you. I hate it when people do that. That is why I try to copy you whenever you do something or say something. I want people to know just how amazing you are because you taught me a lot of things and even repeat it over and over again because my brain doesn’t even go through with what you say.<br><br>
                    The fact you deal with me is enough for me to admire you as a woman. I someday want to be like you, strong, dependable, understanding, and GOD THAT PATIENCE OF YOURS. It is something I want to accomplish for sure because I know I don’t have patience for anyone when something is going on. I unfortunately got that from spending time with Appa. Anger issues are something I’m struggling with, but it makes me happy that you are always there for me. I remember that time when me and Appa had an argument. It was really bad that I started to guilt him, which worked for a bit until you caught me doing that. You scolded me for a solid 2 hours because of the method I was using. It made me feel bad but you were telling me that for a reason. The way you scolded me did make me sad, but I understood why you did it. It made me feel oddly happy because My IRL mom isn’t the best and ignores me all the time. For a moment it felt like you were my mom. It was nice because It was a moment that I wanted to have a mother around.<br><br>
                    You also would read me stories when Zero and Calix were around. I would stick around just to listen and then I would fall asleep too. It was actually sweet because when you kept reading I was able to feel safe with your voice, it’s something about your voice Mom. I like that you made me feel safe. When you were reading the Cultivation story I would fall asleep and when I woke up you were still in call but you were unmuted. I remember I was about to type in the text chat only to realize you fell asleep while reading to me and the others. You were asleep and you kept reading even if we woke up in the middle of the night. I like to think you were asleep for more because you stood up for us past 2 AM. That was the memory I held closely to me even until now.  Mom, I am happy to have met you and I hope I can make you happy with my achievements in the future. I wish you a happy birthday!. I will be a good banana and not be in trouble anymore this year! I promise to watch just like mama watched.<br><br>
                    From,<br>
                    Your banana.</p>

                    I do not know how to speak with words. I struggle with expressing my emotions to you and how happy you make me as a person, lately you already know how I have been struggling to be at ease with myself ever since Zero left us. It has been hard for me to wrap my head around it, but it wasn’t hard to let the pain settle. You were there for me when I needed, made sure I was taking care of myself with every message being made to me. Everyday you were messaging me about my safety, about my life, if I am okay or not. I struggle a bit with my english since it isn’t my main language, but you always keep in mind that even if I struggle with saying words I don’t struggle with expressing it.<br><br>
                    You were by my side when he left us, even told me stories you and Zero shared. I liked the one where you told me that you were on call with him. Zero asked for you to get in call because he had a nightmare, you went in and talked to him just to fill the silence. You talked about Rain and how Zero didn’t like a dream that involved her in it, but how you suddenly switched the topic from that to the topic of stars, It was cute to say the least. You love the night sky so much even for someone who doesn’t talk much. You told him about the story you made up on the spot. I remember it because you told me the story first. How the moon was a goddess, she would search around for her lover, but she didn’t know that her lover was the sun the hid from her. The sun is always asking “Moon? Why do you cry?” and when the moon replies to the sun saying “It is that my fated mate will never see me, I must find him,” or something along those lines. It was cute because you would voice the characters.<br><br>

                    I want to take the time to express my gratitude that you make everyone happy and comfortable. Your kindness and compassion makes this place like a warm home filled with laughter. You’re there for everyone, lending a shoulder for comfort and support. We enjoy reciprocating that love you give us with the biggest energy back to you. I always watch you as you take care of us, reading to us the Scumbag System with a soothing voice. When it was just the two of us in call, the most unbelievable, crazy moments were created. <br><br>
                 
                    The nights where we wouldn’t sleep (by accident sometimes), thank you for being there in those calls with me. Taking the time to talk with me about the topics I was curious about, and assure me a lot of doubt. Even the time to enter the call when I showed you the last letter that Shiro had left for me in DMs. Another thank you for enduring my wailing of my ugly crying. I always ask a lot of questions about Shiro from you, even the stories that I never heard from him. One time, you told me about this one dream he had. The proposal dream. It was really romantic to hear. Both him and I were walking by the beach, having the best date ever. I believe it was the boardwalk if I’m remembering correctly. Except that throughout the whole duration of the dream, my face was like an animal since he didn’t know what I looked like. That is always going to be hilarious to imagine. Another dream was about him walking around with me and papa. Papa and I just talked while he was listening. We were walking by the shore this time. <br><br>
                 
                    There are times where we do get silly. When we do go on FaceTime, you would use the animal filters and be silly. You called the octopus funny, and made a scrunched up face. I’m proud of myself for making you laugh so hard when I used the filter. When I was attempting to make a silly face with the filter, it ended up disappearing for a few seconds and came back. We laughed at how ridiculous I actually looked underneath that filter. We laughed together for at least 5 or 10 minutes. That’s crazy, but we do get crazy together. We couldn’t even breathe as we would try to look each other in the eye and would end back down again. Not too long ago, it was funny that you were sleep deprived and commented about my eyes since I was also having an allergic reaction due to my makeup being smudged all over. Another time with my allergy reaction, you made my face a sticker on the server. You were laughing with Mika and I about how swollen my lips looked. Honestly, that allergy made my lips smooth af, and my makeup still slayed during that whole experience. <br><br>
                 
                    I digress!! From the four or three years that we spent, thank you for being my friend and mother. These memories we made, I cherish them the most. Truly, you are one of the greatest experiences and influences in my life that keeps me going through this journey. <br><br> 
                 
                 Happy 21st birthday, momm!!<br>
                    Sincerely, Froglet</p>

                    I remember the many nights we shared, just the 4 of us, me, Rose, Shiro, and you. We were laughing and even roleplaying our little homes and our oc of what could be us in another life. I was the dragon child you picked up from the streets (crying right now) and Rose was the mushroom princess. Shiro was our sea creature that had horns sticking from his forehead, you were our mother, the moon goddess as I and Shiro called it, Gaho was the Mushroom king. We were in search of your lover which was the sun based on the story you told Shiro. It was until the big goblins got us. I also remember the times in call you would bake and I would be in vc just listening to you talk about whatever was in your mind. You ramble on and on about your day and even about what had happened to you in the past.<br><br>
                    You would read stories to us and I loved the one story which was the Scum system which we never finished. It’s nice to hear the story again after so long. What I loved the most with you was when you relied on me to surprise Papa, you made me hide his birthday gift and it was our little family party. For once I felt like I had an actual functioning family. The moment I was in trouble because my family was involved with the yakuza. It was strange when I was able to say it to you. It’s difficult now, but I've gotten used to living my life with them. I do not plan on using it against anyone, because you taught me better to be a good person and use things for a greater good. To me you are my hero, if it means to protect you I will do anything, that is why your privacy and everyone else’s is important to me. I love you mom.<br><br>
                    Thank you for being the incredible person that you are, a friend, a confidante, and a motherly figure.<br><br>
                    With love and gratitude,<br>
                    Your son.

                It is true when he said that he wanted to be more like you, I believe you are a person with so much potential. It made me sad when I heard that you were having bad luck with love. I just hope now you are happy because it seems like love is what you’re good at. The wisdom you earned is the most thing that is cherished by you. You know how to let go and you know how to do things at the right time. You don’t easily get angry or annoyed like most of us. You stay quiet and always think things through. To say that people don’t give you credit for what you’ve done both mentally and physically with yourself should be a crime!<br><br>
                For you to go far from being someone who worked hard to come to the place you are now. I admire you in every way. If the chance ever comes, I want you to be my mama one day!<br><br>
